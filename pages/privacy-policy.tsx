          Identifiable Information ("PII"). By choosing to participate in our

          and last name, address, phone number, mobile phone number, gender, and
          date of birth. Additionally you may provide other forms of PII during

          Non-Personally Identifiable Information Information collected
          passively by our servers or obtained from third parties ("Non-PII").
          Some information about you is collected by you connecting to our
          website. Rewardingpromos.com's server automatically identifies your
          computer by its internet protocol ("IP") address, a unique string of
          numbers that are assigned to your computer by your internet service
          provider. To participate in our Program and/or Service you must allow
          cookies to be active on your system. Cookies are a feature of web
          browser software (Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, etc.) that allows
          web servers to recognize which computer is used to access a web site.
          Cookies simplify subsequent interactions on our site and streamline
          your transactions on related web pages. Information collected through
          cookies may include the date and time of your visits, the site pages
          you viewed, the time spent at each page, and the web sites you visited
          just before and just after our site. You can disable the cookie
          function by following the instructions in the "help" section of your
          browser. However, doing so will likely make it impossible for our
          system to properly recognize you when you visit our sites, and
          consequently may make your participation in our program more difficult
          or impossible. In addition to the information you provide or that is
          collected automatically from our system, we may obtain information
          about you from our marketing partners or other third parties, and we
          combine that information with the information you actively provide or
          that is automatically collected by our servers. The term "Information"
          is used in this policy to refer to both types of information described
          above, as well as any Information that you provide to us directly by
          phone (including any phone number displayed via caller ID), text or
          SMS message, U.S. mail or through any other written or oral
          communication with Rewardingpromos.com. How we use and Share the

          businesses may include providers of direct marketing services and
          applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement,
          suppression and validation and email marketing. Your email will only
          be shared with our preferred mailing partner for the purpose of

          also be shared with other marketing partners as directly requested by

          marketing partners so that those users opting out of further offers
          are suppressed from the partner's mailings or promotions, as well as
          our own. In addition to complying with our users' preferences, it
          simply makes good business sense to mail only to those customers who
          have indicated a desire to receive such mailings.

          Signals. Most browsers contain a “do-not-track” setting. In general,

          other websites that the user does not want their personal information
          and online behavior to be tracked and used, for example, for
          interest-based advertising. As required by CalOPPA, we are required to
          inform you that, as is the case with most websites, we do not honor or
          alter our behavior when a user to one of our Websites has activated
          the “do-not-track” setting on her/his browser. Nevada Privacy Rights
