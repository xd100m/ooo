          Disclosure of Information Collected and Sold. While users have the
          right to request different levels of disclosure regarding the
          collection, use, disclosure and sale of Information, we have elected
          to treat all requests from California residents as an exercise of
          expanded disclosure requests by businesses that sell Information. Once
          we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will
          disclose to you for the 12 months prior to your request: The

          categories of third parties to whom the Information was sold; and For
          disclosures - the Information categories for each category disclosed
          and the categories of third parties to whom the Information was
          disclosed HOW WE MAY DISCLOSE AND/OR SELL INFORMATION We may share
          and/or sell Information that we have about users in many ways and for
          many purposes, for which we may be compensated, including the
          following (see below for a description of the augmented rights that
          California residents have with respect to opting-out of the sale of
          their Information): With our advertisers, marketing partners and
          service providers for marketing purposes; With our telemarketing

          with delivery of email messaging, telemarketing calls, text/SMS

          appending the user contact information with specific comment language.
          When we share and/or sell Information, we enter into agreements that
          describe the purpose for which the Information is shared/sold,
          restrict its use to the agreement’s specified purpose and require that
          all Information remain confidential, and be protected from
          unauthorized disclosure. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION We use
          commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access or
          disclosure, or accidental loss or destruction of your Information.
          Access to your Information is strictly limited and we take reasonable
          measures to ensure that your Information is not accessible to the
          public. We restrict access to our users’ Information to only those
          persons who need access to perform or provide their job or service,
          both internally and with our third-party service providers. We don’t
          generally collect sensitive Information such as medical information,
          driver’s license/ID card number, health insurance information, data
          collected from an automated license plate recognition system, Social
          Security Number and credit card information. If and when we do
          collect, store and transmit sensitive information, that Information
          will be encrypted with advanced TLS (Transport Layer Security). Given
          the nature of the Internet, your Information passes through entities
          that we are unable to control. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that our
          security measures or those of third parties who access or transmit
          your Information will prevent your Information from being improperly
          accessed, stolen or altered. In compliance with applicable federal and
          state laws, we shall notify you and any applicable regulatory agencies
          if we learn of an information security breach of your Information. You
          will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach. Please be
          advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of
          law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to engage
          in remedial measures. OPTING-OUT FROM MARKETING Users may opt-out from

          advertising opt-out mechanisms such as the Digital Adverting

          interest-based advertising does not mean you will no longer see
          advertising online. Rather, it does mean that the company or companies
          from which you opt-out will no longer show ads that have been tailored
          to your interests.`}
